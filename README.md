## 1. Installation of Anaconda

Anaconda is a powerful platform for Python and data science. You can download and install Anaconda from the official website: [Anaconda Downloads](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

## 2. Using Anaconda Prompt

Once Anaconda is installed, you can use the Anaconda Prompt to manage Python environments and packages. It's essential for managing your Python projects.

To open Anaconda Prompt:
- On Windows, you can find it in the Start menu.
- On macOS and Linux, you can use the terminal and activate the base conda environment.

## 3. Required Visual Studio Code (VSCode) Extensions

For a smooth development experience, make sure to install the following VSCode extensions:
- Python: This extension provides support for Python development in VSCode.
- Jupyter: If you plan to use Jupyter Notebooks within VSCode, this extension is handy.
- Anaconda Extension Pack: Offers additional Anaconda support for VSCode.

You can install these extensions directly from VSCode.

## 4. Making Your First "Hello, World!" Program

To start coding in Python, create a simple "Hello, World!" program to ensure your setup is working correctly. You can do this using VSCode or Anaconda Prompt.

Here's an example Python code for a "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## 5. Creating a Custom Environment with Conda

Anaconda allows you to create isolated Python environments for your projects. You can create a custom environment using the following command in Anaconda Prompt:

```
conda create -n py12 python==3.12 -y
 
```

To activate new environment 

```
conda activate py12
```


## 6. Introduction to Mypy

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. It helps you catch type-related errors early in development. You can install Mypy in your Anaconda environment with pip:

```bash

conda install mypy mypyc
```

## 7. Introduction to Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment for data science and machine learning. To get started with Jupyter Notebook, you can create a new Jupyter Notebook file within VSCode or open the Anaconda Navigator, which provides an interface to launch Jupyter Notebook.

That's it for the first video of the Python Crash Course on Generative AI! In the upcoming videos, we will dive deeper into Python and Generative AI concepts. Happy coding! üêçüöÄ
